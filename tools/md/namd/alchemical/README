alchemical transformation with double-decoupling

first
    `python3 convert.py` (edit first to choose files)
    `./get_pdb.sh` (edit first to choose files) OR get the initial pdb some other way, like by copying from a clustering dir 
    `cp {system}/build/toppar/{ligand}.prm toppar`
    `python3 fix_atomtypes.py` (edit first to choose files)
    
conda to bfee env and run BFEE2Gui.py
    when adding force fields, add cgenff, {ligand}.prm, and extra.prm last (in that order) 
    doubled sim time of steps 1 and 2 (and in colvars) to get 2 ns sampling with the 100 strata. 3 and 4 does 1 ns with 200 strata

After running BFEE2Gui.py to generate BFEE folder
    in the BFEE folder, `./../remove_protein.sh`. It will also neutralize
    `./rename_files.sh`
    `python3 add_GPUresident.py`
    `python3 change_run_settings.py`
    `python3 make_slurms.py`

Then proceed to BFEE/000_eq and start (dont forget to center (see BFEE/Readme.txt))
